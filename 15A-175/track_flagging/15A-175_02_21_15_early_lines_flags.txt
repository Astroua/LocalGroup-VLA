# Note from orig flag script:
# this is very weird data
# you see very extended high ampltidue points... similar to previous tracks but
# this one has very serious tails.
# the probelm is that it's not confined to specfiic time / antenna / baseline / frequencies...

# Agree with above.
# There's a strong PEAK in amplitude for HI near ~0 km/s.
# for 3C48. Something is definitely weird and appears to
# be unrecoverable.

# But the OH lines seems to be fine. This track should be included
# for maser searches.
