# Redefine some scan intents
# Scans 2 and 3 need to be BP/flux/delay only (3C48)
# Scans 4, 5, 9 need to be gain cal only (J2354-1513) 

# ea01, ea02 have large delays in 1 correlation
# scan='2' antenna='ea01'

# ea26 needs flagging in the BP gain cal around 13:37
# Same with ea28
scan='3' antenna='ea26,ea28' timerange='<13:37:10'


# ea01 SPW 9 poor phase solution
# ea19 has some phase scatter in BP
# scan='2' antenna='ea19'

# Phase short gain solutions are all poor. Check which scans
# are being used for this

# One bad SPW in amp gain cal tables. Again related to what is
# being used as the BP/flux cal
# Appears to be SPW 5
